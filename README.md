## Dream App
1. Begin new game
2. new page -> Spieler eingeben (Namen, wie viele, etc.)
3. new page -> connect to spotify
4. Start game button
5. new page -> random song is picked and played (without showing spotify)
   -> while playing there should be: one button per player that can be pushed when you know song
6. push your button when you know song
7. stop song + new page -> time is running down, during which you can guess
8. timer läuft ab
9. new page -> shows song
10. press button wether the guess was correct or not
11. if wrong -> go back to 5
12. if correct -> player has to pick the year it's from (maybe do later)
15. go back to 5
16. stop when somebody has 10 correct songs

## Workflow

- don't forget to convert new lists of songs to uri's
- after a song is picked randomly it should be deleted from the game list, so that it isn't played again
